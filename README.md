# AI Tools - Metadata Templates

## Overview
This project provides a comprehensive set of metadata templates designed to facilitate AI-assisted development through structured documentation and knowledge transfer. It implements the Transfer of Information (TOI) methodology, ensuring project continuity across development sessions.

## Template Descriptions

### AI Context Template
- Provides key project facts and quick reference information
- Defines implementation guidelines and state management principles
- Outlines common task patterns and integration points
- Documents error handling and testing requirements

### Architecture Template
- Describes system components and their relationships
- Details core data structures and interfaces
- Provides implementation guidelines and code organization
- Includes AI-specific implementation notes and performance considerations

### Implementation State Template
- Tracks completed and in-progress features
- Documents known issues and critical dependencies
- Maintains current state of core systems

### Project Tracking Template
- Manages active development tasks and sprints
- Records key milestones and recent completions
- Facilitates session handoffs and continuity

### API Contract Template
- Defines API endpoints and interfaces
- Documents request/response formats
- Specifies validation rules and error handling

### System Constraints Template
- Outlines technical and operational limitations
- Defines performance boundaries
- Documents resource constraints

## Usage
1. Copy relevant templates to your project's documentation directory
2. Fill in the template sections with your project-specific information
3. Update documentation regularly during development
4. Use templates to maintain project continuity across sessions

## Best Practices
- Keep documentation current and accurate
- Include specific examples and context
- Link related information across documents
- Remove outdated information promptly
- Document design decisions and rationale
- Plan for future development sessions
